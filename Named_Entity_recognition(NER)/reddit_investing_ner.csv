&gt;Intel announced Wednesday it will be cutting its quarterly dividend by 66%, saying the move “reflects the board’s deliberate approach to capital allocation.”

&gt;Intel will be cutting its quarterly dividend to 12.5 cents a share , down 66% from its previous dividend of 36.5 cents.

&gt;“The decision to decrease the quarterly dividend reflects the board’s deliberate approach to capital allocation and is designed to best position the company to create long-term value. The improved financial flexibility will support the critical investments needed to execute Intel’s transformation during this period of macroeconomic uncertainty,”

t3_119j98e|1677112653.0|investing|"Hey all, new to options. I'm a longterm investor, and I don't really plan on ever going outside of my comfort zone of choosing positions that I believe in the long term (so nothing outside of covered calls really). I am still confused on just some aspects about covered calls regarding risk and theory.

I have two questions:

1.) When I own 100 shares of AMZN at price 95 (long position). Say my strike price is 102. However within the timeframe of the option, the stock price went DOWN to 89. The option is definitely worthless and will not be exercised. Here, I can collect that premium I got. However, there really is no risk here right? I never planned to sell my AMZN shares in the first place would it have gone down (and instead would have just dollar cost averaged over time). So I collect the premium for free right?

2.) Choosing a strike price that is way OTM. Meaning I have 100 shares of AMZN at 95. What is stopping me from choosing a strike price that is ridiculously high so that I can feel comfortable that it wont really necessarily reach that within the expiration date? Say a strike price of 120. I do understand that the premium that I get would be drastically lower, but what really is the risk to this or con? Something has to give right? I think what I am trying to understand is, someone has to choose to buy the option, and if there is no buyer, then I get no premium however little it is, and I'm only just out 65 cents of the option writing fee right? Or say the premium is absurdly low where it's below even the 65 cents fee were somehow someone actually bought it and i just pay the difference in the premium and the 65 cent fee? This is the theoretical bit I'd like to know. Obviously with covered calls, there is no point if you don't get a premium. 

I really appreciate anyone helping me on this. I'm a long term investor so I don't mind the downside of a stock going down, but I would really like for me to minimize the chance for the call to be exercised (although I definitely know it happens).

t3_119ix8p|1677111807.0|investing|"Hey guys,

I  am heavily invested into ETFs in contrast to singular stocks. They  generate most of my dividends. The more time passes, the more I get  concerned about the underlying, non-visible risks of ETFs.

I  know that in theory they aren't part of the head company (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard..) and if the company goes bankrupt the assets are still there. Also, the ETFs should be 100% covered by underlying assets through a process of creation and redemption by APs. And so on. There are for sure many safety nets available for an exchange traded fund, but  still it's an additional layer of uncertainty.

Possible situations which might occur:

1. Provider goes bankrupt -&gt; assets are frozen for years until all legal issues are solved
2. ETF is worthless due to political risks
3. Due to the risk of insolvency of an ETF provider -&gt; the ETF trades below the asset value -&gt; Low liquidity in contrast to stocks in case of a severe market turmoil.
4. European ETFs are not US ETFs, they are registered often in Ireland -&gt; additional cross country/regulation risk, questionable structure. Another bet on the EU and the surviving of a supranational body.
5. The underlying assets are actually not there at the moment of another market crash bcs of whatever reason

Nr2. already happened: [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239677/ishares-msci-russia-capped-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239677/ishares-msci-russia-capped-etf) Especially the swap ETFs are a 100% lose. With stocks/ADRs the ppl will get back their money (sooner or later).

In reality you might even lose / or get your money frozen in an event, which won't affect all holders of the ""same"" ETF. Like US ETFs will be fine but EU ETFs will be traded below their face value / frozen. Who wants to guess what will happen in 40 years, if no one could ever imagine the last 3 years.

The only solution I see is to switch to stocks and try to imitate an index,  which is fairly not easy. It would be interesting to hear your opinions  about this topic, as I am thinking to switch to a dividend based stock  portfolio -&gt; which I would try to build using an already established  index (question is which one).

t3_119ka38|1677115263.0|investing|"What do you think will happen?

This is my take on the situation:  
Inflation went from transitionary to entrenched quite suddenly last year as an argument to start raising interest rates. These terms seem to be defined by how they're resolved: entrenched inflation is solved by monetary policy while transitionary inflation isn't, instead of describing a specific phenomenon. Using that definition we can call Turkey's inflation transitionary as well.

So let's ignore these terms and try to get a better picture of fundamental and temporary causes for the inflation we experience:

1. international transport is completely disrupted by a pandemic
2. huge sums of money are injected in the economy
3. two years into recovery a war completely disrupts the energy and commodity markets

Each of these triggers causes an acute mismatch between demand and supply. Combined they start cause a ripple effect that seems to result in a feedback loop. We don't know if the loop stops when the initial stimuli fade so the decision is made to raise interest rates.

But when do we lower interest rates again? Should this happen as soon as possible or only if inflation goes below our target? What is the perfect rate? 0? Is it realistic we go back to the pre-2020 situation?

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand central banks raise the interest rates by selling bonds and not releasing that money back to the economy. This reduces the money supply in the economy, and available to buy goods - reducing demand. It should take 6-12 months for this effect to fully materialize.

I don't really get why it works like this and how sure we are this is what happening. I appreciate the elegance using such a simple adjustment and let the system just run its course, but I can't imagine it not being possible to micromanage the system a little more and achieving a way more precise and direct result using taxation."|0.75|4.0|0.0|4.0|[]
t3_119d8nw|1677100141.0|investing|"I recently bought some bonds when the yields spiked - once in November, once recently.  I have about 20k in bonds (face value, not market value) at this point.  The intent was to serve as a source of margin equity or collateral for my other trading, while locking in a decent yield before it went away.  I still have \~3 months worth of expenses in an emergency fund, which is currently in a money market account.

I also know that box spreads can be used to borrow money from the market at rates better than what my broker will charge me, and are secured by my margin equity. If I enter a box spread, it seems like the interest rate I would pay would be offset by the yield on the bond, so I basically get my money back for the duration of the loan without having to sell my bonds. I would also need to decrease my risk exposure during this time, to keep my portfolio value from fluctuating more. Bonds don't fluctuate much in value, though, so I shouldn't get a margin call as long as I don't borrow more than the current value of the bond.  Once I pay off the loan, I would get my margin equity back and can use it elsewhere.  Since my bonds provide such a stable source of equity, would it be practical to use a box spread to borrow against them as necessary and free up the money in my emergency fund?

Also, does anyone know how the trade gets taxed if I keep the spread from year to year?  Does it get listed as a profit one year and a loss the next?  Do I have to close the spread before the end of the year, and reopen it the next year?

I can buy a March 2024 SPY put with strike of $400 for $2,800.

I can put $40k into $XYLG.   This is roughly equivalent in value to 100 shares of SPY (currently trading just under $400).

The distributions from $XYLG from now until next March will probably be somewhere in the ballpark if $2,800... which offsets the put premium.

-They entered the beauty market this year

* Farfetch Ltd announced a number of moves into the beauty business early Wednesday. The luxury e-commerce retailer, which acquired beauty retailer Violet Grey in January, will offer more than 100 brands spread across its banners. U.K. luxury retailer Browns will organize its beauty offerings around quarterly themes and rotating offerings. And Off-White will launch four genderless fragrances to start. Farfetch presents data estimating the value of the luxury beauty market at $69 billion. Farfetch"". ""For 2022, Farfetch's management believes its digital platform GMV will grow between 28% and 32% year over year. It grew 33% in 2021. And it believes its brand platform GMV will grow between 20% and 25%. It grew 20% in 2021. The brand platform represents Farfetch's brands that are shipped and sold in third-party outlets, whereas the digital platform represents first-party and third-party sales on Farfetch's own online marketplace. Digital platform GMV was about eight times larger than brand platform GMV in 2021, so it's encouraging this remains the larger growth opportunity in the coming year.
-FTCH stock is a reasonable investment to consider based on anticipated growth in personal luxury between 3-8% this year.

-Global luxury goods market takes 2022 leap forward and remains poised for further growth despite economic turbulence

-The global luxury market is projected to grow by 21% in 2022, reaching €1.4 trillion; the personal luxury goods market is expected to show accelerated growth of 22% to €353 billion

I've been gambling with FTCH for the last couple of years, and one thing that I've been noticing is that they are investing and buying companies so they can deal with everything. As soon as they stop acquiring companies, they will grow drastically.

I'm understanding that with something like SGOV, you need to multiply your 1099-DIV Box1a Dividends/Interest (basically, anything that passively came to you, vs if you sold ""shares"" and thus generated Capital Gains) by a percentage as published by BlackRock (see link in other post) when you enter it in you taxes (Turbo Tax for me, so it'll flow through to my California return).

Really?? So the 1099-DIV that Fidelity prepares me doesn't already break that stuff out??  

I'm asking because I also have FDRXX Government Cash Reserves which has some treasury items as well, the largest of which is US Gov Repurchase Agreements, but has about 5% in US Treasury Coupons.

And of course this got me thinking about any other ETFs/MMF that might earn interest from US Government obligations.

Can anyone shed light on this?  And specifically, where to go find the percentages to apply to Fidelity funds?  Bonus for Schwab's info since I'll need that for 2023.

It would prefer if the brokerage offers some nice mortgage benefits. I currently have a 10 year IO mortgage so low rates on IO mortgages would be especially preferable.

I'm looking at the below:

 * Interactive Brokers - I'm a little worried that they auto liquidate. Having access to international markets sounds pretty cool, but I don't know that I'll actually use it.

 * Etrade

 * Charles Schwab - Had a bad experience with their mortgage partner. My property didn't fit into their program.

 * ML Edge - Do they even offer futures?

 * JPM Self Directed - Do they even offer futures?

 * Fidelity - Do they even offer futures?

 * Morgan Stanley - Do they have a self directed option other than Etrade? Do they offer futures?

 * UBS - Do they have a self directed option? Do they offer futures?

Interactive Brokers seems like the best considering all the factors, but I'm a little worried that they would be more likely to auto liquidate my account if they get some bad price marks or something.

I feel like the too big to fail bank offerings are a little safer in some bank collapse or fraud scenario because those banks are too big to fail?

Lack of futures isn't a huge deal because I can just open a separate futures account.

Lack of mortgage offerings is also not a huge deal as I can transfer some assets when I need a mortgage in the future.

From what I understand, many people view gold as a ""hedge against inflation"" because it generally maintains its value. However, this is where I start getting confused. I've read that, although gold maintains its value, it's very volatile and doesn't really gain in value much. For instance, I saw a site claim that whatever you could by for an ounce of gold 500 years ago you could buy something comparable to that for the same amount today.

Then, I saw many sites claim the average increase in value of gold is between 0-3% annually. I saw one site that claimed the recent average was 0.92%. But then I see sites that claim it has increased in value 7-10% the last several years, and that it rivals the S&amp;P 500 in terms of ROR.

These rates are all over the place. if it has a 8% return, I'd imagine that would be seen as a good investment, not just a 'hedge against inflation'. But that seems high to me.

I'm new to investment so that's why I'm having trouble identifying what exactly the reality is. I'm not sure why I'm seeing such drastic differences. Is there a difference between the terms ""appreciation"" and ""rate of return"" when it comes to commodities like gold?

Current Situation: investment banks make money from deals and thus are directly correlated with deal flows and the lower middle market is most correlated to the lowest quality, highest risk deals. These companies have gotten slammed given the complete collapse of the new issue market and the the tightening of lending standards depriving their core clientele of access to capital.

What I Like Here: I believe these names will feast once the backdrop improves and the floodgates open on the backlogged ipo pipeline (they won’t be deal runners but they’ll be in the syndicate). In the meanwhile these banks are getting lots of business from ATM facilities as last resort measures from dying clients and they generally pay outsized dividends. Alternatively, there’s consolidation in the space (Cowen and MKM are two recent deals that come to mind) so there’s that angle  as well.

I’m looking for names similar to COWN, JEF, RILY, CCORF, etc. please no regional lenders. No local banks. Can anyone help me come up with a list? Also if anyone knows a good screener that would be helpful as well.

Consider [$VGSH](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vgsh),  the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF. It has a 4.45% SEC yield. Per Vanguard,

&gt;A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (for bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30-day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience. As a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield. 

This yield is essentially in line with the 1 month treasury rate. The most optimistic I can make the ""income yield"" (given the most recent monthly distribution of 12.5 cents, which has been rising) is 2.6%. The expense ratio is 0.04%, so that's not it.

We have $400k combined annual income and already maxed out our Roth 401k and Roth IRA contributions. My wife employer does offer a mega backdoor Roth IRA, so we are considering that as well.

One of the main draws of the IUL for us is the ability to have tax free growth that we can withdraw for (possibly early) retirement. Obviously having a life insurance is a plus, but I understand we can just get a term life and do traditional investing. Seems like one of the main features of IUL is also the fact that there is no loss when the market is down, but with the tradeoff of a cap on the gains when the market is up. This seems like a good way to diversify our portfolio given that our Roth accounts are already exposed to full market movements.

I know some people have the stance of ""insurance and investment should be separate,"" but I would like to understand the reason why as opposed to just the general statement. I'm looking for advice from someone who is intimately familiar with IUL, as well as other forms of investments

https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/glossary/138894/Ongoing%20Charge.aspx

&gt; Ongoing Charge: The Ongoing Charge represents the costs you can reasonably expect to pay as an investor from one year to the next, under normal circumstances. Many investors will be used to looking most closely at the Annual Management Charge, but neither this charge nor the Ongoing Charge includes the performance fees incurred so neither is perfect. However, the Ongoing Charge does represent a more accurate cost of fund ownership as it encompasses the fund’s professional fees, management fees, audit fees and custody fees. 

https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/glossary/98552/expense-ratio.aspx

&gt; Expense Ratio: The expense ratio is the annual fee that all funds or ETFs charge their shareholders. It expresses the percentage of assets deducted each fiscal year for fund expenses, including distribution fees, management fees, administrative fees, operating costs, and all other asset-based costs incurred by the fund.
Portfolio transaction fees, or brokerage costs, as well as initial or deferred sales charges are not included in the expense ratio. The expense ratio, which is deducted from the fund's average net assets, is accrued on a daily basis.

What's the difference between Expense Ratio and Ongoing Charge? I don't see the difference.

I couldn't find an ETF with both the Expense Ratio and Ongoing Charge. E.g., [Morningstar's page on Lyxor Nasdaq-100 Ucits ETF Acc (GBP)](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/etf/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=0P0001FIAQ) only mentions the Ongoing Charge, while the [Morningstar's page on VTI](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vti/quote) only mentions the Expense Ratio."|0.66|6.0|0.0|6.0|['VTI](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs', 'Expense Ratio and Ongoing Charge', 'the Ongoing Charge', 'the Annual Management Charge', 'https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/glossary/98552/expense-ratio.aspx\n\n&gt']

t3_115gb8q|1676729869.0|investing|"As you go along in your investment journey, you will be accosted by all types of wealth managers and advisors who want to help you manage your money. The likes of wealthfront, betterment, and agencies of popular youtubers and podcasters, who use their mike as a client recruitment tool. These companies will typically charge anywhere from 0.25% to 1% your assets that they manage, per year. Seems reasonable on the surface, but is it?

Fees come in different forms. They include services of the advisor, and also the expenses that you pay on a mutual fund or an ETF or any other costs associated with holding the investment. For simplicity, I am lumping everything together for purposes of the calculation below.

Let's say you have $1MM saved up. You invest it in S&amp;P through an advisor and you are paying 1% total fee annually on it. You let it grow for 40 years, and the average rate of growth is 10%. You will end up with around $28MM(!). Sounds fantastic! But what about the fees? I'll give you a minute, take a guess. What do you think the fee that you have paid your wealth manager has grown to?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

.....................................................................

&amp;#x200B;

Over the 40 years, the fees have compounded to **$14MM(!!).** That $14MM is now in the pockets of your financial advisor instead of yours. If you bought the S&amp;P at 0.03%, the fee would have compounded to $500k over 40 years. That means if you simply bought and S&amp;P ETF and did nothing else for 40 years, no meetings with your advisor, no following the financial news, simply went on with your life - an extra $13MM could have been yours to give to your heirs, charity, etc.

This is for $1MM left to grow over 40 years. Wealthier individuals could easily have more that grows untouched, most people focused on growing their wealth won't deplete their accounts to $0 the day they die. If you have your money with wealth managers or advisors, or other custodians, understand that you are not just paying 1%, or 0.75%, or 0.25%. Those payments compound over 40 years to $14MM, $11MM, and $4MM respectively as in the example above.

Am I saying don't use advisors? No. I used to marvel at why people do that when it is so easy to do it yourself with an extremely simple strategy that has a proven track record of beating most professional money managers. I don't have a strong opinion anymore. Your money, yours to do what you wish with it. Money management is a big industry that provides lots of good paying jobs to people, and keeps the financial system and broader economy humming. If you choose to patronize advisors, have at it! Maybe it helps you avoid emotional mistakes, the relationship aspect means something to you, or they open doors to private deals that work out for you (narrator: most of the time they don't).

There are very few things you can control in your investing journey. The fees you pay along the way may be the most important one of all."|0.63|11.0|0.0|11.0|[]

t3_112zgdn|1676471816.0|investing|"Hi all, I would like some help understanding the 4% rule for retirement. 

My goal is to be semi-retired by 50 years old. 

Say I require $20,000 annually to retire, I would first take $20,000*25x which would give me $500,000 

I'm currently 23 years old (Born 2000). I've been investing $300-$400 per month for the past year. I'm currently taking a part time university degree, to avoid student debt I have about 70% in expenses per month. 
I'm likely to graduate in 2028 and I'm expecting a salary of about $5000. I'm planning to invest about $1000 (20%) of my new salary. 

I started with a capital of 1k. During my university I would accumulate about 18k (2023-2028). This leaves me with 22 years of work if I would like to hit my goal of retirement at 50. In this period I would have accumulated around $264,000 (2028-2050). 
That gives me a total of $283,000. 

My question therefore would be does the $500,000 I need at retirement include the interest earned off my principal of $283,000 OR do I actually have to accumulate $500,000 for my principal. 

Thank you so much for the help.

Edit: 
I miss out on this as well, in my country it's required by law that 20% of our salary/mth to be placed into a government retirement account that gives an interest of 3-4% PA. The employer has to contribute 17% of our salary as well on top of that. 

Therefore I would have around 23,786 by the end of college (assuming S&amp;P gives around 6% PA annually). 

I would have about 637,644 by the end of 22 years (assuming no pay raise, no bonuses. Just a flat 1k/mth contribution and 6% PA returns from the S&amp;P) 

I would have about 816,786 from my government account (20% of pay deducted into this account + 17% employer contribution. Assuming no pay raises, no bonuses. 4% PA returns). But this account only starts paying out at 55 years old. Prior to this all the money is locked in by the government. 

 $1478216 by 50, based on those assumptions. Also Medical, housing, college is very heavily subsidized by the government."|0.87|111.0|0.0|111.0|[]

It has a graphic at the bottom but stops Jan 2022. At my first glance, I would say the fed responded faster than in 1975 but then I realized this is real interest rates we are talking about and so it actually might not have been enough of a hike to be much different from '75 so far. 

I know there are obviously supply chain issues and other factors at play that make the overall inflation number more difficult to compare to 50 years ago but I wanted to ask if people here thought the Fed didnt respond quick enough or hawkish enough at the beginning to avoid a longer tail to this mess.

It explains Microsoft's position relative to  OpenAI's Chat\_GPT and Google Bard.  It's very good background to understanding the power that is coming from the chat bots that are in development and how they may be deployed

Some may note that last November Nvidia and Microsoft  [announced](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai) they would build a ""massive"" AI server utilizing Nvidia parts as their key compute engines.  Servicing Bing Chat is clearly what that massive server is about, at least initially.   Microsoft is clearly going after all the eyeballs Google has attracted, something on the order of **8 BILLION** searches a day.

As a thought exercise:  If Google's 8B searches are basically up for grabs, imagine for a moment how many other companies will need systems  that are competitive with Bing Chat.   Not just Google, but Facebook,  Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba.    Then there are the second  tier guys, folks like IBM, and Oracle  and Salesforce.  And dozens of others in Europe, Asia, Australia etc.

Circle back to the article referenced for a moment.  The author used the analogy that Chat\_GPT was like a Ford Model T, and Bing Chat is like a 1968 Lincoln.   He then concludes a section:  ""And again:  This is a 1968 Lincoln. Just wait until the latest-model Tesla shows up.""

This is what makes Nvidia a very compelling long term play.  They are building the guts to all those  Tesla-esque data centers that need to be built out.

1st phase is the portfolio management phase lasting 2 weeks, and the teams with the highest portfolio return are chosen to proceed to phase 2. Here, we are allowed to invest in ODFs, T-Bills, Fixed rate treasury notes and treasury bonds. We can also participate in weekly auctions of T-Bills and government bonds.

2nd phase is the trading phase lasting 7 weeks (this is a person to person thing). We trade among other teams and we are allowed to edit rates between + or - 25 bps of the previous day's BVAL rate.

The questions I'd like to ask are:

1. What are the best practices for bond trading especially in these cases?
2. What data are we supposed to have on our radar to find bond opportunities (whether under-, or overvalued, especially with this competition based around Philippine securities)

My analysis has led me to believe that it is indeed profitable. But maybe I'm wrong, of course. Can you help? I want to see your expert opinions.

Why do I think so - there is a continuing trend around the world to make life easier for people and many countries are continuing to build new cities, factories, plants, and the like.

And what will they need? Right! Roads!

The Internet told us that, for example, in China, in one province - one province alone - over $80 billion was invested in road construction last year, bringing investors a 20-27% return on investment.

And then there is Russia, where there are thousands of kilometers of roads, and India and Asian countries... Hundreds of thousands of kilometers will be built.

And if the yield is at least 20%, it's a great way to overtake inflation and make money. Isn't that what we all want?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I have so far based on my google snooping:

**PROS**

Gold is uncorrelated to both stocks and bonds

Generally increases risk adjusted returns when combined with a traditional 60/40 portfolio

Gold can be thought of as a zero coupon bond that increases in premium when real rates go negative. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

Gold is not as good of an inflation hedge as commonly believed. It behaves unpredictably most of the time during inflation spikes. It may be used as a hedge against inflation if the investment horizon is centuries.But, considering a typical investor's lifespan, whether gold will hedge inflation or not will be mostly up to chance. TIPS and overall commodity indexes are arguably a better inflation hedge.

Gold can be as volatile as equities but with zero expected returns since it's a non-productive asset with zero cash flows

Gold can go through very long drawdown periods i.e. someone who invested in gold in early 80s was underwater for 20-30 years

For all of my accounts, at least for the time being, I am not looking for something I need to be checking daily, weeky or even monthly. The ""set and forget"" approach is very appealing to me due to the number of other priorities that require my attention. Also of note, my employer sponsored 401(k) is through Vanguard while my Roth IRA and standard brokerage account are with Fidelity.

That said, here is my current setup:

* 401(k) 100% in Vanguard target date 2065 fund
* Roth IRA (current value $22000) invested in about 10 different companies
* Standard brokerage account ($2000 + $500/mo) just opened

Given the above info, here is my current plan:

1. Leave my 401(k) in the target date fund and contribute as aggressively as I can (sensibly) afford.
2. I am going to sell most positions in my Roth IRA and invest in one or two broad market ETFs (also open to putting a small % in global ETFs as well). I have some holdings in Google, Amazon and Walmart and I see no reason to sell those. I have had all three for a couple of years now.

I don’t think that they are going anywhere due to the fact that their software and products are integrated in many different places. But at times, I worry that companies such as google, Apple, and Microsoft may have their most profitable days behind them because technology is already apart of our lives and not some huge fad like it was 20-30 years ago. To be clear, I still think they are good buys (especially now), that’s just a concern I have thought about

So here’s my case on why you should buy Apple for the next 5+ years 

Over the next 5-10 years, I believe more 3rd world countries will start adopting technology even more than they already have. And Apple will undoubtedly be apart of this integration. 

Apple is currently working on a car. Now, nobody really knows how far in production the car is, but a lot of people are reporting it would be released in 3 years (2026). I don’t think that Apple will release it unless it’s perfect, but if they do than it will probably be a huge hit. 

Lastly, Apple has bought more AI software firms than any other company (including meta). I believe that over the next few years they will start integrating softwares such as Chatgpt into their search engine functions. 

Am I missing something? What do you think about Apple?"|0.67|12.0|0.0|12.0|['Apple', 'Chatgpt', 'AI', 'Microsoft']
t3_115gb8q|1676729869.0|investing|"As you go along in your investment journey, you will be accosted by all types of wealth managers and advisors who want to help you manage your money. The likes of wealthfront, betterment, and agencies of popular youtubers and podcasters, who use their mike as a client recruitment tool. These companies will typically charge anywhere from 0.25% to 1% your assets that they manage, per year. Seems reasonable on the surface, but is it?

Fees come in different forms. They include services of the advisor, and also the expenses that you pay on a mutual fund or an ETF or any other costs associated with holding the investment. For simplicity, I am lumping everything together for purposes of the calculation below.

Let's say you have $1MM saved up. You invest it in S&amp;P through an advisor and you are paying 1% total fee annually on it. You let it grow for 40 years, and the average rate of growth is 10%. You will end up with around $28MM(!). Sounds fantastic! But what about the fees? I'll give you a minute, take a guess. What do you think the fee that you have paid your wealth manager has grown to?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

.....................................................................

&amp;#x200B;

Over the 40 years, the fees have compounded to **$14MM(!!).** That $14MM is now in the pockets of your financial advisor instead of yours. If you bought the S&amp;P at 0.03%, the fee would have compounded to $500k over 40 years. That means if you simply bought and S&amp;P ETF and did nothing else for 40 years, no meetings with your advisor, no following the financial news, simply went on with your life - an extra $13MM could have been yours to give to your heirs, charity, etc.

This is for $1MM left to grow over 40 years. Wealthier individuals could easily have more that grows untouched, most people focused on growing their wealth won't deplete their accounts to $0 the day they die. If you have your money with wealth managers or advisors, or other custodians, understand that you are not just paying 1%, or 0.75%, or 0.25%. Those payments compound over 40 years to $14MM, $11MM, and $4MM respectively as in the example above.

Am I saying don't use advisors? No. I used to marvel at why people do that when it is so easy to do it yourself with an extremely simple strategy that has a proven track record of beating most professional money managers. I don't have a strong opinion anymore. Your money, yours to do what you wish with it. Money management is a big industry that provides lots of good paying jobs to people, and keeps the financial system and broader economy humming. If you choose to patronize advisors, have at it! Maybe it helps you avoid emotional mistakes, the relationship aspect means something to you, or they open doors to private deals that work out for you (narrator: most of the time they don't).

There are very few things you can control in your investing journey. The fees you pay along the way may be the most important one of all."|0.61|9.0|0.0|9.0|[]

t3_112zgdn|1676471816.0|investing|"Hi all, I would like some help understanding the 4% rule for retirement. 

My goal is to be semi-retired by 50 years old. 

Say I require $20,000 annually to retire, I would first take $20,000*25x which would give me $500,000 

I'm currently 23 years old (Born 2000). I've been investing $300-$400 per month for the past year. I'm currently taking a part time university degree, to avoid student debt I have about 70% in expenses per month. 
I'm likely to graduate in 2028 and I'm expecting a salary of about $5000. I'm planning to invest about $1000 (20%) of my new salary. 

I started with a capital of 1k. During my university I would accumulate about 18k (2023-2028). This leaves me with 22 years of work if I would like to hit my goal of retirement at 50. In this period I would have accumulated around $264,000 (2028-2050). 
That gives me a total of $283,000. 

My question therefore would be does the $500,000 I need at retirement include the interest earned off my principal of $283,000 OR do I actually have to accumulate $500,000 for my principal. 

Thank you so much for the help.

Edit: 
I miss out on this as well, in my country it's required by law that 20% of our salary/mth to be placed into a government retirement account that gives an interest of 3-4% PA. The employer has to contribute 17% of our salary as well on top of that. 

Therefore I would have around 23,786 by the end of college (assuming S&amp;P gives around 6% PA annually). 

I would have about 637,644 by the end of 22 years (assuming no pay raise, no bonuses. Just a flat 1k/mth contribution and 6% PA returns from the S&amp;P) 

I would have about 816,786 from my government account (20% of pay deducted into this account + 17% employer contribution. Assuming no pay raises, no bonuses. 4% PA returns). But this account only starts paying out at 55 years old. Prior to this all the money is locked in by the government.

It has a graphic at the bottom but stops Jan 2022. At my first glance, I would say the fed responded faster than in 1975 but then I realized this is real interest rates we are talking about and so it actually might not have been enough of a hike to be much different from '75 so far.

So basically I know that ISAs have a 20k a year deposit limit.

Say I stick 20k in there, which I don’t have yet but hopefully will by the time the year ends, and invest all of that, then I would have maxed out my limit with Vanguard. But my question is, because I’ve already deposited that 15k cash into Moneybox this year as available cash not a cash ISA but in to my stocks and shares ISA - not a cash ISA, can I continue investing that 15k in stocks and shares in Moneybox next year too, as well as the 20k in Vanguard because I deposited it in a previous financial year as cash? So in essence I want to know if I could invest £35k in to stocks and shares next financial year because the money would already be in my ISA from the previous financial year.

Labor market is still really hot and overall, I don't think it would be ignorant to assume rates will go up by more as a result. However, judging by the price, the opposite sentiment was held (or better said none at all). Prices looked completely removed from the outcome of today's report and the bull flag set-up towards the end of the day makes things even more confusing.

Even though my thesis was CPI was spot on. My thesis on how markets would respond was completely off and I still cannot logically understand how or why this happened.

My question is - what is the functional difference between throwing spare cash into VOO (a Vanguard 500 ETF), vs directly with Vanguard to invest in an index fund? I know the technical difference is that VOO allows intraday trading, whereas for a true index fund, only the closing price is when you can trade in at.

To that end, if there was a market crash tomorrow and the equities market dropped 20%, is there truly a difference in your 30 year outlook if you just threw $40k into VOO, vs having Vanguard put your $40k into an index fund? Are there dangers that aren't readily apparent with throwing it into an Index Fund ETF vs an Index Fund? Trying to understand the difference in these two instruments, because it seems like an Index Fund ETF is just an easier, more liquid form of an Index Fund at Vanguard."|0.71|16.0|0.0|16.0|['an Index Fund', 'Vanguard', 'VOO']

[https://www.thebulwark.com/microsoft-is-getting-ready-to-eat-googles-lunch-bing-chat-chatgpt/](https://www.thebulwark.com/microsoft-is-getting-ready-to-eat-googles-lunch-bing-chat-chatgpt/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email)

It explains Microsoft's position relative to  OpenAI's Chat\_GPT and Google Bard.  It's very good background to understanding the power that is coming from the chat bots that are in development and how they may be deployed

Some may note that last November Nvidia and Microsoft  [announced](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai) they would build a ""massive"" AI server utilizing Nvidia parts as their key compute engines.  Servicing Bing Chat is clearly what that massive server is about, at least initially.   Microsoft is clearly going after all the eyeballs Google has attracted, something on the order of **8 BILLION** searches a day.

As a thought exercise:  If Google's 8B searches are basically up for grabs, imagine for a moment how many other companies will need systems  that are competitive with Bing Chat.   Not just Google, but Facebook,  Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba.    Then there are the second  tier guys, folks like IBM, and Oracle  and Salesforce.  And dozens of others in Europe, Asia, Australia etc.

Circle back to the article referenced for a moment.  The author used the analogy that Chat\_GPT was like a Ford Model T, and Bing Chat is like a 1968 Lincoln.   He then concludes a section:  ""And again:  This is a 1968 Lincoln. Just wait until the latest-model Tesla shows up.""

This is what makes Nvidia a very compelling long term play.  They are building the guts to all those  Tesla-esque data centers that need to be built out.

""\[NVIDIA\] has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, accounting for about 86% of the [computing power](https://techwireasia.com/2022/11/nvidia-microsoft-collaborates-to-build-the-most-powerful-ai-supercomputers/) of the world’s six largest cloud services as of last December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis.""

Google and Microsoft may have ""the data"" to be leadership in AI.  But they haven't yet touched gloves while the opening bell is still reverberating on what is certain to be a 15 round cage match with a number of other 800 lb gorillas.   Nvidia on the other hand earned [$14.5B revenue](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q323.pdf) TTM on data center hardware -- primarily focused on AI training and inferencing.   So let google and msft and amazon and the rest slug it out -- it's impossible to know who will win.

Meanwhile Nvidia just toils away developing and deploying [crucial technology](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/) that is in high demand, and is becoming a massive company."|0.36|0.0|0.0|0.0|['Jefferies', 'IBM', 'Nvidia', 'Bing Chat', 'nvidia-microsoft', 'Oracle  and Salesforce', 'nvidia-microsoft-collaborates-', 'Lincoln', 'Google Bard', 'Apple', 'Baidu, Tencent', 'Amazon', '8B', 'AI /', 'Tesla', 'Google', 'AI', 'Microsoft']

My analysis has led me to believe that it is indeed profitable. But maybe I'm wrong, of course. Can you help? I want to see your expert opinions.

Why do I think so - there is a continuing trend around the world to make life easier for people and many countries are continuing to build new cities, factories, plants, and the like.

And what will they need? Right! Roads!

The Internet told us that, for example, in China, in one province - one province alone - over $80 billion was invested in road construction last year, bringing investors a 20-27% return on investment.

And then there is Russia, where there are thousands of kilometers of roads, and India and Asian countries... Hundreds of thousands of kilometers will be built.

And if the yield is at least 20%, it's a great way to overtake inflation and make money. Isn't that what we all want?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I have so far based on my google snooping:

**PROS**

Gold is uncorrelated to both stocks and bonds

Generally increases risk adjusted returns when combined with a traditional 60/40 portfolio

Gold can be thought of as a zero coupon bond that increases in premium when real rates go negative. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

Gold is not as good of an inflation hedge as commonly believed. It behaves unpredictably most of the time during inflation spikes. It may be used as a hedge against inflation if the investment horizon is centuries.But, considering a typical investor's lifespan, whether gold will hedge inflation or not will be mostly up to chance. TIPS and overall commodity indexes are arguably a better inflation hedge.

Gold can be as volatile as equities but with zero expected returns since it's a non-productive asset with zero cash flows

Gold can go through very long drawdown periods i.e. someone who invested in gold in early 80s was underwater for 20-30 years

Obviously it will not directly affect index prices, but population drops have to be a factor. Not sure how immigration and international demographics/access to US markets factor in either, but given that stock prices really are not directly derived from GDP or earnings, isn't it possible that demographics reducing retirement account purchases could reduce real buy pressure across markets? How much of the phenomenon of indexe prices always going up is from populations hitherto always increasing? Anyone else thought about this and already done the research?"|0.9|236.0|0.0|236.0|[]

I don’t think that they are going anywhere due to the fact that their software and products are integrated in many different places. But at times, I worry that companies such as google, Apple, and Microsoft may have their most profitable days behind them because technology is already apart of our lives and not some huge fad like it was 20-30 years ago. To be clear, I still think they are good buys (especially now), that’s just a concern I have thought about

So here’s my case on why you should buy Apple for the next 5+ years 

Over the next 5-10 years, I believe more 3rd world countries will start adopting technology even more than they already have. And Apple will undoubtedly be apart of this integration. 

Apple is currently working on a car. Now, nobody really knows how far in production the car is, but a lot of people are reporting it would be released in 3 years (2026). I don’t think that Apple will release it unless it’s perfect, but if they do than it will probably be a huge hit. 

Lastly, Apple has bought more AI software firms than any other company (including meta). I believe that over the next few years they will start integrating softwares such as Chatgpt into their search engine functions.

t3_115gb8q|1676729869.0|investing|"As you go along in your investment journey, you will be accosted by all types of wealth managers and advisors who want to help you manage your money. The likes of wealthfront, betterment, and agencies of popular youtubers and podcasters, who use their mike as a client recruitment tool. These companies will typically charge anywhere from 0.25% to 1% your assets that they manage, per year. Seems reasonable on the surface, but is it?

Fees come in different forms. They include services of the advisor, and also the expenses that you pay on a mutual fund or an ETF or any other costs associated with holding the investment. For simplicity, I am lumping everything together for purposes of the calculation below.

Let's say you have $1MM saved up. You invest it in S&amp;P through an advisor and you are paying 1% total fee annually on it. You let it grow for 40 years, and the average rate of growth is 10%. You will end up with around $28MM(!). Sounds fantastic! But what about the fees? I'll give you a minute, take a guess. What do you think the fee that you have paid your wealth manager has grown to?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

.....................................................................

&amp;#x200B;

Over the 40 years, the fees have compounded to **$14MM(!!).** That $14MM is now in the pockets of your financial advisor instead of yours. If you bought the S&amp;P at 0.03%, the fee would have compounded to $500k over 40 years. That means if you simply bought and S&amp;P ETF and did nothing else for 40 years, no meetings with your advisor, no following the financial news, simply went on with your life - an extra $13MM could have been yours to give to your heirs, charity, etc.

This is for $1MM left to grow over 40 years. Wealthier individuals could easily have more that grows untouched, most people focused on growing their wealth won't deplete their accounts to $0 the day they die. If you have your money with wealth managers or advisors, or other custodians, understand that you are not just paying 1%, or 0.75%, or 0.25%. Those payments compound over 40 years to $14MM, $11MM, and $4MM respectively as in the example above.

Am I saying don't use advisors? No. I used to marvel at why people do that when it is so easy to do it yourself with an extremely simple strategy that has a proven track record of beating most professional money managers. I don't have a strong opinion anymore. Your money, yours to do what you wish with it. Money management is a big industry that provides lots of good paying jobs to people, and keeps the financial system and broader economy humming. If you choose to patronize advisors, have at it! Maybe it helps you avoid emotional mistakes, the relationship aspect means something to you, or they open doors to private deals that work out for you (narrator: most of the time they don't).

There are very few things you can control in your investing journey. The fees you pay along the way may be the most important one of all."|0.62|10.0|0.0|10.0|[]

US retail sales increased sharply in January, the latest in a series of hotter-than-expected economic data that may force the Federal Reserve to keep tightening monetary policy for longer to slow the American economy.

Retail sales, which include spending on food and fuel, rose 3 per cent last month over December’s levels, the Census Bureau said on Wednesday. It was one of the biggest monthly increases of the past 20 years and surpassed economists’ expectations for a 1.8 per cent increase.

t3_112zgdn|1676471816.0|investing|"Hi all, I would like some help understanding the 4% rule for retirement. 

My goal is to be semi-retired by 50 years old. 

Say I require $20,000 annually to retire, I would first take $20,000*25x which would give me $500,000 

I'm currently 23 years old (Born 2000). I've been investing $300-$400 per month for the past year. I'm currently taking a part time university degree, to avoid student debt I have about 70% in expenses per month. 
I'm likely to graduate in 2028 and I'm expecting a salary of about $5000. I'm planning to invest about $1000 (20%) of my new salary. 

I started with a capital of 1k. During my university I would accumulate about 18k (2023-2028). This leaves me with 22 years of work if I would like to hit my goal of retirement at 50. In this period I would have accumulated around $264,000 (2028-2050). 
That gives me a total of $283,000. 

My question therefore would be does the $500,000 I need at retirement include the interest earned off my principal of $283,000 OR do I actually have to accumulate $500,000 for my principal. 

Thank you so much for the help.

Edit: 
I miss out on this as well, in my country it's required by law that 20% of our salary/mth to be placed into a government retirement account that gives an interest of 3-4% PA. The employer has to contribute 17% of our salary as well on top of that. 

Therefore I would have around 23,786 by the end of college (assuming S&amp;P gives around 6% PA annually). 

I would have about 637,644 by the end of 22 years (assuming no pay raise, no bonuses. Just a flat 1k/mth contribution and 6% PA returns from the S&amp;P) 

I would have about 816,786 from my government account (20% of pay deducted into this account + 17% employer contribution. Assuming no pay raises, no bonuses. 4% PA returns). But this account only starts paying out at 55 years old. Prior to this all the money is locked in by the government.

So basically I know that ISAs have a 20k a year deposit limit.

Say I stick 20k in there, which I don’t have yet but hopefully will by the time the year ends, and invest all of that, then I would have maxed out my limit with Vanguard. But my question is, because I’ve already deposited that 15k cash into Moneybox this year as available cash not a cash ISA but in to my stocks and shares ISA - not a cash ISA, can I continue investing that 15k in stocks and shares in Moneybox next year too, as well as the 20k in Vanguard because I deposited it in a previous financial year as cash? So in essence I want to know if I could invest £35k in to stocks and shares next financial year because the money would already be in my ISA from the previous financial year.

To that end, if there was a market crash tomorrow and the equities market dropped 20%, is there truly a difference in your 30 year outlook if you just threw $40k into VOO, vs having Vanguard put your $40k into an index fund?

[https://www.thebulwark.com/microsoft-is-getting-ready-to-eat-googles-lunch-bing-chat-chatgpt/](https://www.thebulwark.com/microsoft-is-getting-ready-to-eat-googles-lunch-bing-chat-chatgpt/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email)

It explains Microsoft's position relative to  OpenAI's Chat\_GPT and Google Bard.  It's very good background to understanding the power that is coming from the chat bots that are in development and how they may be deployed

Some may note that last November Nvidia and Microsoft  [announced](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai) they would build a ""massive"" AI server utilizing Nvidia parts as their key compute engines.  Servicing Bing Chat is clearly what that massive server is about, at least initially.   Microsoft is clearly going after all the eyeballs Google has attracted, something on the order of **8 BILLION** searches a day.

As a thought exercise:  If Google's 8B searches are basically up for grabs, imagine for a moment how many other companies will need systems  that are competitive with Bing Chat.   Not just Google, but Facebook,  Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba.    Then there are the second  tier guys, folks like IBM, and Oracle  and Salesforce.  And dozens of others in Europe, Asia, Australia etc.

Circle back to the article referenced for a moment.  The author used the analogy that Chat\_GPT was like a Ford Model T, and Bing Chat is like a 1968 Lincoln.   He then concludes a section:  ""And again:  This is a 1968 Lincoln. Just wait until the latest-model Tesla shows up.""

This is what makes Nvidia a very compelling long term play.  They are building the guts to all those  Tesla-esque data centers that need to be built out.

""\[NVIDIA\] has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, accounting for about 86% of the [computing power](https://techwireasia.com/2022/11/nvidia-microsoft-collaborates-to-build-the-most-powerful-ai-supercomputers/) of the world’s six largest cloud services as of last December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis.""

Google and Microsoft may have ""the data"" to be leadership in AI.  But they haven't yet touched gloves while the opening bell is still reverberating on what is certain to be a 15 round cage match with a number of other 800 lb gorillas.   Nvidia on the other hand earned [$14.5B revenue](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2023/q3/Rev_by_Mkt_Qtrly_Trend_Q323.pdf) TTM on data center hardware -- primarily focused on AI training and inferencing.   So let google and msft and amazon and the rest slug it out -- it's impossible to know who will win.

Why do I think so - there is a continuing trend around the world to make life easier for people and many countries are continuing to build new cities, factories, plants, and the like.

And what will they need? Right! Roads!

The Internet told us that, for example, in China, in one province - one province alone - over $80 billion was invested in road construction last year, bringing investors a 20-27% return on investment.

And then there is Russia, where there are thousands of kilometers of roads, and India and Asian countries... Hundreds of thousands of kilometers will be built.

And if the yield is at least 20%, it's a great way to overtake inflation and make money. Isn't that what we all want?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I have so far based on my google snooping:

**PROS**

Gold is uncorrelated to both stocks and bonds

Generally increases risk adjusted returns when combined with a traditional 60/40 portfolio

Gold can be thought of as a zero coupon bond that increases in premium when real rates go negative. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

Gold is not as good of an inflation hedge as commonly believed. It behaves unpredictably most of the time during inflation spikes. It may be used as a hedge against inflation if the investment horizon is centuries.But, considering a typical investor's lifespan, whether gold will hedge inflation or not will be mostly up to chance. TIPS and overall commodity indexes are arguably a better inflation hedge.

Gold can be as volatile as equities but with zero expected returns since it's a non-productive asset with zero cash flows

Gold can go through very long drawdown periods i.e. someone who invested in gold in early 80s was underwater for 20-30 years

* Standard brokerage account ($2000 + $500/mo) just opened

Given the above info, here is my current plan:

1. Leave my 401(k) in the target date fund and contribute as aggressively as I can (sensibly) afford.
2. I am going to sell most positions in my Roth IRA and invest in one or two broad market ETFs (also open to putting a small % in global ETFs as well). I have some holdings in Google, Amazon and Walmart and I see no reason to sell those. I have had all three for a couple of years now.
3. I would like to invest my brokerage account into VYM in the hopes of someday (think near retirement age) having a small secondary source of income from it.

I have a few questions:

1. Is the target date fund a sensible place to keep my 401(k) funds?
2. What do you think of FZROX and FZILX for my Roth IRA? Maybe an 80/20 split with most in the domestic market?
3. Does my plan to invest in a high dividend yield ETF seem foolish? Or can this pan out over time?

Obviously it will not directly affect index prices, but population drops have to be a factor.

I don’t think that they are going anywhere due to the fact that their software and products are integrated in many different places. But at times, I worry that companies such as google, Apple, and Microsoft may have their most profitable days behind them because technology is already apart of our lives and not some huge fad like it was 20-30 years ago. To be clear, I still think they are good buys (especially now), that’s just a concern I have thought about

So here’s my case on why you should buy Apple for the next 5+ years 

Over the next 5-10 years, I believe more 3rd world countries will start adopting technology even more than they already have. And Apple will undoubtedly be apart of this integration. 

Apple is currently working on a car. Now, nobody really knows how far in production the car is, but a lot of people are reporting it would be released in 3 years (2026). I don’t think that Apple will release it unless it’s perfect, but if they do than it will probably be a huge hit. 

Lastly, Apple has bought more AI software firms than any other company (including meta). I believe that over the next few years they will start integrating softwares such as Chatgpt into their search engine functions. 

Am I missing something? What do you think about Apple?"|0.67|13.0|0.0|13.0|['Apple', 'Chatgpt', 'AI', 'Microsoft']
t3_115gb8q|1676729869.0|investing|"As you go along in your investment journey, you will be accosted by all types of wealth managers and advisors who want to help you manage your money. The likes of wealthfront, betterment, and agencies of popular youtubers and podcasters, who use their mike as a client recruitment tool. These companies will typically charge anywhere from 0.25% to 1% your assets that they manage, per year. Seems reasonable on the surface, but is it?

Fees come in different forms. They include services of the advisor, and also the expenses that you pay on a mutual fund or an ETF or any other costs associated with holding the investment. For simplicity, I am lumping everything together for purposes of the calculation below.

Let's say you have $1MM saved up. You invest it in S&amp;P through an advisor and you are paying 1% total fee annually on it. You let it grow for 40 years, and the average rate of growth is 10%. You will end up with around $28MM(!). Sounds fantastic! But what about the fees? I'll give you a minute, take a guess. What do you think the fee that you have paid your wealth manager has grown to?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

.....................................................................

&amp;#x200B;

Over the 40 years, the fees have compounded to **$14MM(!!).** That $14MM is now in the pockets of your financial advisor instead of yours. If you bought the S&amp;P at 0.03%, the fee would have compounded to $500k over 40 years. That means if you simply bought and S&amp;P ETF and did nothing else for 40 years, no meetings with your advisor, no following the financial news, simply went on with your life - an extra $13MM could have been yours to give to your heirs, charity, etc.

This is for $1MM left to grow over 40 years. Wealthier individuals could easily have more that grows untouched, most people focused on growing their wealth won't deplete their accounts to $0 the day they die. If you have your money with wealth managers or advisors, or other custodians, understand that you are not just paying 1%, or 0.75%, or 0.25%. Those payments compound over 40 years to $14MM, $11MM, and $4MM respectively as in the example above.

Am I saying don't use advisors? No. I used to marvel at why people do that when it is so easy to do it yourself with an extremely simple strategy that has a proven track record of beating most professional money managers. I don't have a strong opinion anymore. Your money, yours to do what you wish with it. Money management is a big industry that provides lots of good paying jobs to people, and keeps the financial system and broader economy humming. If you choose to patronize advisors, have at it! Maybe it helps you avoid emotional mistakes, the relationship aspect means something to you, or they open doors to private deals that work out for you (narrator: most of the time they don't).

There are very few things you can control in your investing journey. The fees you pay along the way may be the most important one of all."|0.61|10.0|0.0|10.0|[]

US retail sales increased sharply in January, the latest in a series of hotter-than-expected economic data that may force the Federal Reserve to keep tightening monetary policy for longer to slow the American economy.

Retail sales, which include spending on food and fuel, rose 3 per cent last month over December’s levels, the Census Bureau said on Wednesday. It was one of the biggest monthly increases of the past 20 years and surpassed economists’ expectations for a 1.8 per cent increase.

My goal is to be semi-retired by 50 years old. 

Say I require $20,000 annually to retire, I would first take $20,000*25x which would give me $500,000 

I'm currently 23 years old (Born 2000). I've been investing $300-$400 per month for the past year. I'm currently taking a part time university degree, to avoid student debt I have about 70% in expenses per month. 
I'm likely to graduate in 2028 and I'm expecting a salary of about $5000. I'm planning to invest about $1000 (20%) of my new salary. 

I started with a capital of 1k. During my university I would accumulate about 18k (2023-2028). This leaves me with 22 years of work if I would like to hit my goal of retirement at 50. In this period I would have accumulated around $264,000 (2028-2050). 
That gives me a total of $283,000. 

My question therefore would be does the $500,000 I need at retirement include the interest earned off my principal of $283,000 OR do I actually have to accumulate $500,000 for my principal. 

Thank you so much for the help.

Edit: 
I miss out on this as well, in my country it's required by law that 20% of our salary/mth to be placed into a government retirement account that gives an interest of 3-4% PA. The employer has to contribute 17% of our salary as well on top of that. 

Therefore I would have around 23,786 by the end of college (assuming S&amp;P gives around 6% PA annually). 

I would have about 637,644 by the end of 22 years (assuming no pay raise, no bonuses. Just a flat 1k/mth contribution and 6% PA returns from the S&amp;P) 

I would have about 816,786 from my government account (20% of pay deducted into this account + 17% employer contribution. Assuming no pay raises, no bonuses. 4% PA returns). But this account only starts paying out at 55 years old. Prior to this all the money is locked in by the government.

t3_112v950|1676458050.0|investing|Right I'm probs making this sound a lot more complicated than it is but I dunno how best to explain it and summarise it as best I can cos I just really don't understand it. So basically I know that ISAs have a 20k a year deposit limit. I have a Stocks &amp; Shares ISA with Moneybox – only 5k of that is in actual stocks and shares and then there’s 15k in cash because, although it’s a stocks and shares ISA, the interest rate on the cash sitting there is really good. Next financial year I want to open up a stocks and shares ISA with Vanguard. Say I stick 20k in there, which I don’t have yet but hopefully will by the time the year ends, and invest all of that, then I would have maxed out my limit with Vanguard. But my question is, because I’ve already deposited that 15k cash into Moneybox this year as available cash not a cash ISA but in to my stocks and shares ISA - not a cash ISA, can I continue investing that 15k in stocks and shares in Moneybox next year too, as well as the 20k in Vanguard because I deposited it in a previous financial year as cash? So in essence I want to know if I could invest £35k in to stocks and shares next financial year because the money would already be in my ISA from the previous financial year. It’s not a Cash ISA where my money is sitting, it’s sitting as 'available cash' in my stocks and shares ISA.

It explains Microsoft's position relative to  OpenAI's Chat\_GPT and Google Bard.  It's very good background to understanding the power that is coming from the chat bots that are in development and how they may be deployed

Some may note that last November Nvidia and Microsoft  [announced](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-microsoft-accelerate-cloud-enterprise-ai) they would build a ""massive"" AI server utilizing Nvidia parts as their key compute engines.  Servicing Bing Chat is clearly what that massive server is about, at least initially.   Microsoft is clearly going after all the eyeballs Google has attracted, something on the order of **8 BILLION** searches a day.

As a thought exercise:  If Google's 8B searches are basically up for grabs, imagine for a moment how many other companies will need systems  that are competitive with Bing Chat.   Not just Google, but Facebook,  Apple, Amazon, Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba.    Then there are the second  tier guys, folks like IBM, and Oracle  and Salesforce.  And dozens of others in Europe, Asia, Australia etc.

Circle back to the article referenced for a moment.  The author used the analogy that Chat\_GPT was like a Ford Model T, and Bing Chat is like a 1968 Lincoln.   He then concludes a section:  ""And again:  This is a 1968 Lincoln. Just wait until the latest-model Tesla shows up.""

This is what makes Nvidia a very compelling long term play.  They are building the guts to all those  Tesla-esque data centers that need to be built out.

""\[NVIDIA\] has a commanding share of high-end AI chips, accounting for about 86% of the [computing power](https://techwireasia.com/2022/11/nvidia-microsoft-collaborates-to-build-the-most-powerful-ai-supercomputers/) of the world’s six largest cloud services as of last December, according to Jefferies chip analyst Mark Lipacis.""

But they haven't yet touched gloves while the opening bell is still reverberating on what is certain to be a 15 round cage match with a number of other 800 lb gorillas.

And what will they need? Right! Roads!

And then there is Russia, where there are thousands of kilometers of roads, and India and Asian countries... Hundreds of thousands of kilometers will be built.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what I have so far based on my google snooping:

**PROS**

Gold is uncorrelated to both stocks and bonds

Generally increases risk adjusted returns when combined with a traditional 60/40 portfolio

Gold can be thought of as a zero coupon bond that increases in premium when real rates go negative. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CONS**

Gold is not as good of an inflation hedge as commonly believed. It behaves unpredictably most of the time during inflation spikes. It may be used as a hedge against inflation if the investment horizon is centuries.But, considering a typical investor's lifespan, whether gold will hedge inflation or not will be mostly up to chance. TIPS and overall commodity indexes are arguably a better inflation hedge.

Gold can be as volatile as equities but with zero expected returns since it's a non-productive asset with zero cash flows

Gold can go through very long drawdown periods i.e. someone who invested in gold in early 80s was underwater for 20-30 years

I mean, it seems like if you're following some douchebags flashing gold watches and peddling penny stocks that yeah, if you follow their advice then you're an idiot. But then I read that these guys had like 250,000 people in their discord at one point? That's a lot of idiots and so it stands to reason that they pulled in some fairly smart people as well.

And the thing is I'm guessing that a lot of these groups exist but probably aren't anywhere near as loud and obvious about it. But if someone was running some sort of community and was marketing themselves as more serious and professional, and maybe was in their late 30's, 40's, or 50's, I could see myself getting taken in.

t3_111g4m1|1676312819.0|investing|"I have heard conflicting advice on where I should park my bonds.  Here are the 2 statements I have heard:

1.  Bonds are going to grow much more slowly and have less risk compared to stocks so save your tax advantaged accounts for stocks since they have more growth potential.  This way you'll have less of a tax burden when it comes time to sell. 

2.  Bonds are tax disadvantaged so it makes sense to store them in a tax advantages account (like a Roth IRA) to avoid paying extra taxes.

These are contradictory.  Which is correct and what should I do??  

Keep all my bonds in taxable accounts? In taxable advantaged accounts (Roth, 401k, HSA etc)? Or just mirror the same percentage in both (90:10, 80:20 etc)?

t3_111sfmo|1676344776.0|investing|"Hi all, 22yo here looking to set myself up for the best stable financial success possible.

For all of my accounts, at least for the time being, I am not looking for something I need to be checking daily, weeky or even monthly. The ""set and forget"" approach is very appealing to me due to the number of other priorities that require my attention. Also of note, my employer sponsored 401(k) is through Vanguard while my Roth IRA and standard brokerage account are with Fidelity.

That said, here is my current setup:

* 401(k) 100% in Vanguard target date 2065 fund
* Roth IRA (current value $22000) invested in about 10 different companies
* Standard brokerage account ($2000 + $500/mo) just opened

Given the above info, here is my current plan:

1. Leave my 401(k) in the target date fund and contribute as aggressively as I can (sensibly) afford.
2. I am going to sell most positions in my Roth IRA and invest in one or two broad market ETFs (also open to putting a small % in global ETFs as well). I have some holdings in Google, Amazon and Walmart and I see no reason to sell those. I have had all three for a couple of years now.
3. I would like to invest my brokerage account into VYM in the hopes of someday (think near retirement age) having a small secondary source of income from it.

I have a few questions:

1. Is the target date fund a sensible place to keep my 401(k) funds?
2. What do you think of FZROX and FZILX for my Roth IRA? Maybe an 80/20 split with most in the domestic market?
3. Does my plan to invest in a high dividend yield ETF seem foolish? Or can this pan out over time?

&amp;#x200B;

I know my early years can have a huge impact on my financial future, so I appreciate all the assistance and guidance I can get! Thank you all in advance for the help."|0.6|2.0|0.0|2.0|['Walmart', 'Fidelity', 'VYM', 'Amazon', 'Vanguard', 'Google']

At the same time, my understanding is that volatility is already factored into the pricing when you buy a option, so it takes more than average volatility to make profit.

Over the long-term obviously more important to protect against losses than participate in all the gains. 2 questions for those with more aggressive positioning:

1. Do you incorporate any other asset classes like gold or commodities to provide some protection? Probably too young to be in fixed income yet.

Obviously it will not directly affect index prices, but population drops have to be a factor. Not sure how immigration and international demographics/access to US markets factor in either, but given that stock prices really are not directly derived from GDP or earnings, isn't it possible that demographics reducing retirement account purchases could reduce real buy pressure across markets? How much of the phenomenon of indexe prices always going up is from populations hitherto always increasing? Anyone else thought about this and already done the research?"|0.9|236.0|0.0|236.0|[]
